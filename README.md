## EcoVerse: Smart Waste segregator UI
This web application uses AI to help users automatically segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories by simply uploading an image of the waste.

ðŸ§  How It Works
> The user uploads an image containing various waste items.
> The app uses an AI-powered object detection model (from Hugging Face) to identify the items in the image.
> Based on a predefined mapping, each detected object is classified as either biodegradable (e.g., fruits, vegetables, paper) or non-biodegradable (e.g., plastic bottles, metal cans).
> The results are visually displayed, highlighting and labeling each item as Bio or Non-Bio.

ðŸŒ¿ Why Use This WebApp?
> Proper waste segregation is crucial for sustainable waste management and recycling. This tool helps:
> Educate users about the types of waste.
> Encourage responsible disposal habits.
> Automate waste categorization in a simple, user-friendly way.
